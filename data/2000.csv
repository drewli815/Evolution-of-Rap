Headlights, shine so bright
Bitches freeze like deers

Feds send in a decoy, pack that heat boy
Push ya where ya rest in peace boy
Get your mama's house shot up
Bodies all chopped up
When them bodies pop up, I ain't getting' locked up
My Bentley cruise the block, with the sun roof top
Hood rats jumpin' on my jock cause I blew up the spot
Crushin' your Benz, crushin' your Navigator system
My QB piece make y'all niggas tuck your shit in
It's Nas in your area, Queens 'bout to tear it up
Braveheart y'all scared of us, real niggas, they be us

[Missy & Lil' Mo]
What's your name?, cause I'm impressed
Can you treat me good, I won't settle for less
You a hot boy, a rock boy
A fun toy, tote a Glock boy
Where you live, is it by yourself?

Ruff Ryders scream it loud, daddy is you with it
If your team can't handle my bitches then we gon' ride
Brickhouse stallions, keep thugs open wide, huh

Mess with many, but if he ain't the realer
I ain't with it, with it

Mmmmm, I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
(Come on!)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

[Verse 1]
Mmmmm, you can find me in St. Louis rolling on dubs
Smoking on dubs in clubs, blowing up like Cocoa Puffs
Sipping Bud', getting perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs and it's
All because accumulated enough scratch just to
Navigate it, wood decorated on chrome and it's
Candy painted, fans fainting while I'm entertaining
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
I hang with Hannibal Lecter (Hot shit!)
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (What?), I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the 'cause, I'm righteous, above the law
Player my style's raw, I’m Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's Ebonics, gin, tonic, and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slamming niggas like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die
And I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

""How nigga?""
Ask me again and it's going down, nigga
Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown, nigga
Pound niggas, what you be giving when I'm around nigga
Frown niggas, talking that shit when I leave the town, nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now?
Hey, I'm ready to cut you up any day now
Play by my rules, boo, and you gon' stay high
May I answer your Third Question like A.I
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma
From St. Louis to Memphis, from Texas back up to Indiana
Chi-Town, K.C., Motown to Alabama
L.A., New York Yankee niggas, to Hotlanta
Louisiana, all my niggas with ""Country Grammar""
Smoking blunts in Savannah, blow thirty mil', like I'm Hammer

Let's show these cats to make these
Millions so you niggas quit acting silly, mon
Kid quicker than Billy, mon, talking really and I need it mon
Flows, I kick 'em freely mon, especially off Remi, mon
Keys to my Beemer, mon, holler at Beenie Man
See me, mon, chiefin', rollin' deeper than any mon
Through Jennings mon, through U-City back up to Kingsland
With nice niggas, sheist niggas who snatch yo' life, niggas
Trife niggas who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga

From broke to having brokers, my price-range is Rover
Now I'm knocking like Jehovah; let me in now, let me in now

Spend now, I got money to lend my friends now
We in now, candy Benz, Kenwood and 10's now

Seeing now, through the pen I make my ends now

4,Flamboyant,Big L,"June 24, 2000","[Intro]
Yeah, yeah! Big L, Corleone
My nigga C-Town, my big brother Big Lee holding it down
Flamboyant, baby, for life
We taking over, coming to a theater near you
Check it out, come on, check it

[Verse 1]
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
Better watch me 'round your girl if you ain't fuckin' her right
You damn playa haters never want to see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment CEO
Yo, the spotlight is mine, it ain't his no more
When Lee come home, niggas can't live no more
And I'm straight, keep a Harlem World mindstate
I never lounge where you find Jake
Suprise niggas like a blind date, L rhyme great
And I'mma increase the crime rate for old time's sake
Run with me and I'm a make you a star
When me and my crew hit the clubs, we go straight to the bar
Leave 'em empty, I cruise through Harlem in an M3
Never pay for parties, say my name and I'm in free
I'm on some 100-G car shit, superstar shit
Selling niggas that wet shit right out the jar shit
I'm dumb hot, I'll wreck you and your young flock
Keep the gun cock, represent one block
139, nigga, the Danger Zone
We quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
I'm known to kick a rough rhyme and rock much shine
Yo, I'm out, I done took up enough time

[Talking]
We out, no doubt
You know how we do
Flamboyant for life

[Refrain]
Big L, Corleone
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
Big L, for real
Corleone is too advanced for y'all
Big L, I'm a pimped-out nigga for real
Big L, Corleone is too advanced for y'all

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's Corleone and Queen's Most
We bust 'til your whole team ghost
Everywhere we go, we must bring toast
Forever poppin' the chrome, always droppin' a poem
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
However you want it is
How I'm gonna give it to you, Big L style
They brought it back to the streets ‘cause that shit sell now
So pal, back up a bit, give me some elbow space
I represent Harlem World, not Melrose Place
So I'ma lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyent is the label that writes the checks
Y'all niggas better stop fronting ‘cause I might get vexed
And I'ma run up on y'all and slice yours necks
With the machette, pockets heavy
Slang more cane than Eddie; I represent uno tres nueve
Time is money, so I stay late, I'm quick to slide a playmate
Bust off like a tre-eight then vacate

It's like I been doin' a lot of interviews
Just people be callin 'my name everywhere, ""Hey, Zane!""
(So crazy, life's so, crazy)
Come on

[Verse 1: Lil Zane & (Slim)]
I live the life of a celebrity
A made nigga way bigger than them other cats you love to see
I'm getting paid like I'm supposed to
My homies call me on my mobile wanna hang we still close too
I switched positions with them po’ cats, I write raps
Make millions like that, I like that
And I never was a rich man
A rubber band for a wrist band
Got dough and had to switch plans
Drama still don't stop
The freeway, getting chased by some bad bitches
Wanting autographed pictures (Ooh)
They want my name tattooed on them
Thinkin' for a minute, hit that ass, make a move on 'em
Hey! Hennessy with the chardonnay, mix it
I put the trees in the Garcay, twist it (Whoa, yeah)
A true player smoking purple haze
Two shots in the air for my true thugs out there

[Chorus: Q Parker & (Slim)]
This life I live of mine (Oh yeah)
This life is crazy (So crazy)

Let me explain what the game is like
I did a show in California, had to be in Las Vegas the same night
Me and 112 on the same flight, getting tired
It ain't easy being worldwide
(Worldwide, worldwide, worldwide)
I seen murder come with fame in this rap game
Gotta stay strapped if you rap so I pack thangs
All my niggas pack thangs, and plus we love to ball
Don't want no problem with you, homie, I mean none at all
And to my rich cats with them big faced bills in the air
My po' cats sell more sex to you there
Love green millionaires, been all around the world
Turned the squares into true players
Cheap watches turned to Cartiers, locals turned to gators
Point 3's turn to 5 C's all these car keys
Jump in the Benz, hit The Shark Bar
You know they love to see a hot star

[Chorus: Q Parker & (Slim)]

This life I live of mine (Yeah)
This life is crazy (So crazy)

Calling me, calling me, calling me (Hey Lil' Zane!), say my name

[Verse 3: Lil Zane]
And for my dogs I ain't seen in awhile
I still got love for y'all ain't got a chance to return your call
I'm in Chicago, I'm getting paid
Man, bigger figgas everywhere that I go
I'm still hearing about drama poppin' in the hood
Heard that you niggas doing good and I like that
Irv said niggas got the block locked
He tell me K and Big Chris riding drop tops
Flossin', I'm getting letters, hard to write back
Put a fly picture in the mail, hope they like that
Prayin' that the fame don't kill us all
The magazines to the big screen
It ain't easy as the shit seems
Throwin' up my deuces as a pass by
Showing love to the south side, all the players outside
And we gon' spend G's tonight
Hotel's on me, shit's free tonight
C'mon!

[Chorus: Q Parker & (Slim)]
This life I live of mine (Yeah)
This life is crazy (Oh, so crazy)
I waste no time at all
They won't stop calling me
This life I live of mine
This life is crazy
I waste no time at all
They won't stop calling me
Calling me, calling me, calling me (Hey Lil' Zane!), say my name
Calling me, calling me, calling me (Hey Lil' Zane!), say my name (Crazy)

This life I live of mine (Crazy)
This life is crazy (Oh)
I waste no time at all
They won't stop calling me

With a couple of clydesdales
Sippin zinfandel
Got a sack of good, take a whiff, inhale
Blaze up, hate to ball and bail
Got some late cut, she sure now how to shake her tail
The way I hit it, make her wanna break up
And leave her man, make up
And cheat again, caked up
Lay low, Comfort Inn, tucked her in
Next week she said she'll bring a friend
Come on

[Andre]
She said I love my man, man man man
We got our ups and downs and I'll get lonely and, and and and
Wanna move move to someone who might understand, stand stand stand
How to make a girl feel like Alice in Wonderland...wonderland...wandered in
Wonderin'...if she can home with guilt on her mind
Really all she truly wants to know is that she still fine
After day you met her, better tell her, 'fore another feller
Pet her kitten, sittin' sittin', chittin' chittin', spittin' spittin', hittin' hittin'

Had to check a broad yesterday for grilling you down
Shut it down quick cuz me still wanna see these rounds

Repeat 1

You know you chose the best when you singled me out
I got these cats at close range, I'm contagious to these lames
We broke game, it's time to kill game, I feel your pain
They wanna stretch you for some change
Never worry boo, I'm not gon' change
It's gon' still feel the same
Besides you said you done with with them games
It ain't no love loss
I hollar that you know you're in, let's lead a new cause
Boss bitch, and I can put that on the cross
I'mma bang for you, and we gon' pull through
So when I release you from them balls
We gon' look up at the stars, notice those stars
They moving inside us, to get us it's gotta meant war
And as for them broads, you know the rules
It ain't a chicken alive that can walk in my shoes
I payed dues, they see the Bentley pull up, brand new
What the fuck, they better get on the bus
Remember the dreams about the house up on the hill
Spinning the bottle, quarter mill', want a meal

Repeat 1

I got a fettish for thugs, rugged with mean mugs
When he lonely, he phone me to please 'em
Jeans saggin', buy size 12, like all damn
As he unclothed my mind froze, like oh man
Underestimated, but for one, she's just a faded
Call it how I see it, shoot the game, I'm tryin' to play it
(So into you and your Davison House shoes)
To flip a yay and choppin' bricks
(It figures beyond six)
And he not incarcerated, departed and used to hate
He couldn't wait 'till you hit the gates to get activists ready
Your type is what I'm diggin', gossip heard obsolete
Plans occurred on the sneak, swing surperb and unique
Keep your pimpin' in tight, addicted like all night
Like eight inches, six pack, dig that, it's alright
Dead G over at ??? burn like opium
He's a straight trophy, and grip tight, I'm holding on

Repeat 1

11,Oh No,Mos Def and Pharoahe Monch featuring Nate Dogg,"January 20, 2001","[Intro: Mos Def]
One for the treble, two for the bass
Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace

[Hook 1: Nate Dogg]
Oh No!
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been 7 days, the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim, I independently lay it down
And played my game, my own two raise my flame
Cause dickriding ain't my thang
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm getting it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad cause I'm getting caked out from my bookings
When y'all was asking permission I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
Cause after this year the price ain't coming down
And if you got a joint bubbling then get money now
Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble coming out
Just a warning, as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard-headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame the jealous gaze is too short to see it
But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent, or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evenin
You keep on scheming, man give me some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screaming ""Lord Jesus!""
Harder than y'all cause I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down it's got to be bothering y'all
Pay attention, watch Flaco get larger than y'all
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do or die stay rumbling and bumbling hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all
East coast on your neck and you ain't shrugging it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumbling off
I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggas are the sons of New York
Getting spanked when there's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

[Hook 2: Nate Dogg]
Oh No!
Look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn, they know
We rock from the east to west coast
Queens, salute to Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages of wackness, Pharoahe's raps are blazin
And it amazes - me how you claim thug
But go two-ways without Skytel pagers
I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East L.A
More beef then deli's, thus what I vent is just
What you lust to vent, it's irrele'
Huh, hallelujah, Pharoahe Monch'll do ya
Maintain the same frame of mind - screw ya!
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, greet ya with scriptures
I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leaving you mentally unfocused here
MC's just come on 'round!
You're the next contestants on ""Catch-A-Beat-Down""
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment
It's evident we medicine for your whole town
Sky's the limit, game's infinite when I'm in it
All windows is tinted
How you seeing me when I'm in it?
Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that
Pharoahe's flows blows shows like afros
We hate y'all though, that's why Nate Dogg goes

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Oh No!
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been 7 days, the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Oh No!
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been 7 days, the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Oh No!
Look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn, they know
We rock from the east to west coast
Queens, salute to Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold

Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Bridge: André 3000]
Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
""Look at the way he treats me""
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Yo, man

Open up, man
Yo, what you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You made her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man...
I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killa
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player you haffi know how fi play
If she say, “a night”, convince her, say, “a day”
Never admit to a word when she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, “Baby, no way!”

[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & Shaggy]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Make she know say that she really no have right fi vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else weh favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the likkle evidence, you betta know fi mask
Quick 'pon yuh answer, know how fi talk
But if she pack a gun, you know you betta run fast

[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & Shaggy]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)

Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)

Bangin' on the bathroom floor

All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

[Bridge: Rikrok]
Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor

'Cause Bow Wow's here and it's over! Ya heard?
I'm this, I'm that, I'm all of the above
In a big body shotgun, ridin on dub's
I've been seen with the baddest, heard with the best
And I got it locked down from the East to the West
Look at my eyes, ya know; I ain't playin'
That's why all through the streets

What makes it even worse, I'm just getting started

Yeah, that's me that's got her arguing with her friends about

All that and a bag of chips; ""Hi! My name is..""

Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five or six strippers tryna work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said

[Chorus: Claudette & Robby]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry?
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life
Mmm

Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be livin' all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hopin' to die

Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more [shit] that you can't even relate to""

I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers

To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (Whoops!)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!
*Gunshots* I said come on, bounce!
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (Me!)
Not weed, I meant coke; dumb-ass, sit down! (Oh)
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin' out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out (Come on)

[Verse 2: Kuniva, Kon Artis (& Eminem)]
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid 'cause the X is gone
Yeah, I took 'em all, dawg, with some Parmesan
And I think my arm is gone — No, it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary-ass, it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Well, stop actin' stupid; you so high
That you might wake up with a guy on some new shit
Yeah, I think I did too much (Huh-uh)
This substance equals cuffs (Huh-uh)
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills — (That's ill!) — Mescaline

[Chorus: Eminem]
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

[Bridge: Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other
Out and date each other
Some, some, some
Somethin'... I don't know

[Verse 3: Proof & Bizarre]
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray look for dope to smoke?
No? Okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
(*Coughing*) Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by a whore lady
Now I gotta strangle an {infant} (You're crazy!)

[Verse 4: Swift, Bizarre (& Eminem)]
I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine
(Hey, you got any shrooms?) Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs, 'cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack, then I might too
(Swift, chill!) I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (Huh-uh)
Speed, shrooms, down the Valiums (Huh-uh)
Even smoke weed out of vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin' back soon

[Chorus: Eminem]
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
I'm at a rave, lookin' like a slave
High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin'
Dope-heady guy
Heroin mescaline
Pencil leads, wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals
Got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill (Yeah, right)
Bitch, I'm for real!
Shut yo' mouth, you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt
Let Bizarre nut!

[Chorus: Eminem]
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice, but who's countin'?
But nothin' compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

[Bridge: Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other

Shoppin sprees with ease to fill up a 2000 Suburb, ha

Although the rent ain't nuthin but two-fifty
We sportin five thousand dollar drapes
Makin it happen, wit snappin to avoid that - anchor

So put my city on the map
Hook me up wit million dollar vocal cords

20,Dansin wit Wolvez,Strik 9ine,"November 24, 2001","To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

Remix, Jonell, Def Jam, Method Man, How High

[Verse 1: Jonell]
All the game that you were spittin', I know that you was trippin'
Never thought to see me dippin' but I had to get missin'
I'm tired of you stressin' me, why don't you let it be
Comin around cussin' me, fuckin' wit me mentally
Goodbye, don't wanna see your face no more
So long, pack your bags want you out the door
Cause, every time that I play this ruggy
Time and time again it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain it's gonna rain it's gonna rain

[Verse 2: Method Man]
There you go again flippin' on me
One minute we the shit next minute you shittin' on me
So what's the problem huh?
No wait, let me guess, gimme some space
And some place to get a load of your chest
No better yet you don't get enough attention at home
And when I'm gone I don't even think to pickup the phone
I'm dead wrong, now your fed up, packin' my stuff, fuckin' my head up
And I see it in your face right now you wish I shut up

[Chorus: Jonell]
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!

[Verse 3: Jonell]
If you don't understand where I'm comin' from
Then my heart is tellin' me you're not the one
All the games you played and now you lied
You're not the one, for me no more so baby bye bye
Pack yo' bags and get to steppin'
You got to let it go you need to stop trippin'
(I hope you don't think I'll let you back in)
Cause youse, a, fool

[Chorus: Jonell]
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!

[Bridge: Jonell]
Don't waste, your time
Ya fooled me once but not a second time
Now it's time for you, to go away
I packed your things nothing else for us to say......but...bye!!!

[Verse 4: Method Man]
I was gutter when ya met me, gutter when ya left me
Gutter when ya came back face it nothin' can change that
Not romance nor romance counselin'
You drop the ball now i'm bouncin'
Find me a room burn up an ounce and
Waitin' for my baby to call foregive it all
On some break up to makeup shit givin' me draws
I dore mi amor, but everytime she choose to go to war
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Verse 5: Jonell]
To-day I made up my mind - to get away
Every-day, I sit and pray, everyday, every-day
To-day I made up my mind - to get away
Every-day, I sit and pray, everyday, every-day

[Chorus: Jonell]
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!
I really don't know what you came here for
Round and around we go!
Consider your bags outside the door
Round and around we go!"

Killin one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns
Plus I'm do' low at a table

Dances around, she struts with the ""fuck"" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk

You's a dime piece, I'm tryin to see somethin
Suck your t's and in your front and lemme squeeze somethin

You got drama, never mind that
Naughty by Nature, 3L-Dub, all star tracks
We got that flavor that make your hands clap, toes tap
And crossin cultural and generation age gaps
Never can you fade that
We make your body like rock to this
Everybody's block party's gonna wop to this
So to the family here's another one
And all those haters who ain't thinkin we still havin fun
Better throw your towel in son
How many years have we proved we can do this?
How many people we inspired to pursue this?
Well if you wanna test the mental the truth is
Naughty by Nature makes that Feel Good music

[Hook]

[Treach]
Dang, Dang, I don't wanna go
The party ain't a party if it ain't... Naughty
Body to body dance... Naughty
Oh lordie, its IIcon and Naughty
It's the groove move more of us hate, come on tour with us
IF everybody smiles it makes the whole day glorious
Sliiiide left, sliiiiide right
Throw your hands high - I know that's right!
Now I strong, we ride strong, double IIcons
Wanna stop hurtin better let bygones be bygones
Sliiiide left, sliiiiide right
Dance ya spine out, wind let me find out
Ooh-ah Ooh-ah, outdoor with indo'
Aiyyy-yo! Drop the keys out the window
We got the wally with my yardies we partyin
Cause, after the party its the after-party and..

[Hook]

[3LW]
Feels good, feels good, baby clap your hands (Hey, Hey)
Feels good, feels good, baby clap your hands
Feels good, feels good, baby clap your hands (Hey, Hey)
Feels good, feels good, baby clap your hands
(Hey, don't worry bout a damn thang)

26,Oh Boy,Cam'ron featuring Juelz Santana,"June 15, 2002","[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Cam'ron]
Just Blaze! (Oh baby)
Oh baby, uh, Killa!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
All the girls see the (boy), look at his kicks (boy)
Look at his car (boy), all I say is (oh boy)
Look mami, I'm no good, I'm so hood
Clap at your soldiers sober, then leave after it's over, Killa
I'm not your companion, or your man's stand-in
Hit me when you wanna get rammed in, I'll be scramblin'
With lots of mobsters, shop for lobsters
Cops and robbers, listen every block is blaka (BLAKA!!!)
But she like the way I diddy bop, you peep that?
Mink on, Mauri kicks plus Chanel ski hat
She want the (boy), so I give her the (boy)
Now she screamin' out (boy, boy, boy, boy), Killa, Killa
Now she playin' with herself, Cam dig it out, lift her up
Ma, it's just a fuck, girl, get it out, pick on up
They want the boy Montana with guns with bandanas
Listen to my homeboy Santana

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Y'all niggas can't fuck with the (boy), I'm tellin' ya (boy)
Put a shell in ya (boy) now he bleedin' (oh boy)
Get him, call his (boy) he wheezin' he need his (boy)
He screamin' (boy, boy, boy, boy)
Damn, shut up (boy), he's snitchin' (oh boy)
This nigga's bitchin' (boy), he's twisted (oh boy)
If Feds was listenin' (boy), damn, whoa, whoa, c'mon...
I'm in trouble need bail money, shit
Where the fuck is my (boy)? I got trust for my (boy)
That's why I fuck with my (boy), that's my nigga (oh boy)
He gon' come get his (boy), he got love for his (boy)
That's my (boy, boy, boy, boy) uh huh, uh huh

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
When he got caught with the (boy), we went to court for the (boy)
Just me and my (boy), and we sayin' (oh boy)
Be on the block with my (boy) with the rock or the (boy)
When the cops come - Squalie!
Yeah this is for the sports cars, Bonita's, Jimmy's
PJ's, old school, eighteenth at the sports bar
Eight or nine on the (boy), holla at your boy
Killa, holla, listen
It's the D-I-P (boy) plus the R-O-C (boy)
You'll be D-O-A (boy), your moms will say (oh boy)
Shit, ain't no stoppin' 'em, guns we got a lot of 'em
Shit, matter of fact, Guru start poppin' 'em
Then slap up this (boy), clap up his (boy)
Wrap up his (boy), get them gats (oh boy)
Diplomats are them (boy) for the girls and the (boy)
Say (boy, boy, boy, boy)

[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Now when they see Cam and his (boy), they say damn (oh boy)
Santana's that (boy) that squeeze hammers (oh boy)
Cannons and bandanas, blammers we don't brandish
Blam at your man's canvas then scram with your man's leaded
And I'm back with my (boy)

[Verse 5: Cam'ron]
Until that man is vanished
Away in the Grand Canyon, these kids are grand standin'
Niggas demand ransom over them grams scramblin'
(Boy, boy, boy, boy)
Well fuck it, Van Damme 'em, Cam'll blam blam 'em
Call up his (boy), I'm down south tannin'
Mami, I got the remedy, Tommy's up at the enemy
Homi's and bodies, but now my body you're feelin' finicky
Killa and Capo, we chill in Morocco for reala
We got dough, chinchilla dough and fill with them hollows, huh

[Intro: Cam'ron]
I wanna welcome you to an extravaganza
Something incredible that's about to take place
World renowned

[Break: Memphis Bleek]
Geah, geah, nigga

[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
Yo, yo, my break I'm fresh off it

But I'ma do it for my enemies
They wanna end my chill, wanna see what that villa be
Now, what that sound like?
Plus, they know what a clip get down like
Turn bags from bladders, legs to wheels, pain and pills
'Cause you fucking with a nigga that'll jump out, wave the steel
I live this way, it's real, dog, it's no joke
Blow smoke in your bitch face, piss on your wheels
Slap ya custies, clap ya worker, dead the strip
Stick your connect, yap your bitch
So let it be known, I'm back on my grizzly
The Sergeant, the Cap, the MAC holds 60
For rookies and vets, I'll bang 'til it click (Click)
So run and tell ya dude the Ruger come with two clips, dog
M-Easy, won't leave, my hood need me
Pop, fa-sheezy, who, don't believe me?
We all criminals but live like a Diplomat
We get low, when the dough low, get it back

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Here is somethin' you can't understaaaaaaaaand
How I could just kill a man for Killa Cam
Me and my Roc killer fam, top billers, man (Man)
We run the spots, drop ceilings fam (Fam)
Hit the wall drop ceiling fans (Ugh)
Listen boy, man I show you how to fill a van, up with killers man
And line the trunk, keep a stash box for the nine and the pump
The coach walk you through and he grind you up
What-chu want the dope or the weed?
How you want package it? In the cap or the bag?
How you want me packing? With the MAC or the Mag?
Yeah that Bent get back, but listen, scrap, act real fast
And keep a wack that'll gag your back
Block style from your swagger, your swacks
It's the Broad Street Bully, bitch
Bully niggas on the broadest streets
I house niggas on the narrowest block!
Know my rules when the barrel get hot, when the gun blows
And the shots fall, and the smoke clear
Man I be hearin' you were murdered (You ain't here!)
Nobody hit up in the cross 'cause I'm observin' (You ain't here!)
Nobody be missin' your loss 'cause you deserved it
South Philly niggas kill at will
I keep my MAC-milli CHILLY CHILL (Ugh)
On the really-real, 'fore I make you niggas feel this steel...

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]

Go 'head stupid niggas go fuck with them chicks

Better yet the bakery I got pies and cakes
Nigga think doublin' is turnin' 5 to 8
I turn 8 to 20, 20 to 100, 100 to 1000
That to 100,000, in front-a housin'
Closed the mall down, dog, no one's allowed in

It's the top don, Glock palm, dot com
Get your shit rocked mon like Hasim Rahman
And I'm extra scary
CEOs all the frontin' ain't necessary (why?), I fuck they secretaries
All for information, it ain't necessary
They in love like the 14th of February
Play 'em like April 1st right before I slide off
It could be March 2nd, sound like July 4th
Halloween or Memorial Day
At your memorial be one year from today (today)
All y'all think it's peace and peachy
I leave you reesy piecy, all my bitches rock
Christian Dior, BCBG, 'round phony niggas get the heeby jeebies
Hungry hoes say ""Killa feed me, feed me...""
Calm down ma, easy easy

Still rock Ellesses, to squeeze appease me
He ain't no tease but measly
Not Doggy's Angels, Killa, please believe me... uhh

[Outro: scratches]
You now rollin' with them thugs from the R-O-C

I was sittin' here thinkin' like
Big Daddy Kane and Public Enemy
Salt n Pepa, Lyte, EPMD, LL, Run-DMC
KRS-One, Rakim
Most of them artists used to dance
And still get respected in the street
Don't be scared to Bankhead or Bogo
Or move as far as sold Michael Jackson 43 million
Shoot, errbody have the zipper jacket
And half of these thugs have the glove to match, ya feel me?
Yo, it's ok though, if you wanna be hard and ice grill
And Harlem Shake at the same time, whatever
Let's just have fun, it's hip-hop man, this is hip-hop!"

Big boys

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em

[Verse 2: Kyjuan]
Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

[Verse 3: Ali]
Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

[Verse 4: Murphy Lee]
Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 5: Murphy Lee]
We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin there as if I'm shootin free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""

[Verse 6: Ali]
I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops,  which are clear so
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe
Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""

[Verse 7: Kyjuan]
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem

[Verse 8: Nelly]
Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my daytons

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 9: Kyjuan]
I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

[Verse 10: Murphy Lee]
Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (wow) fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

[Verse 11: Nelly]
Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

[Verse 12: Ali]
Now where da boxes where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine , (beep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones

33,21 Questions,50 Cent featuring Nate Dogg,"May 3, 2003","Hi, I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Ja Rule. Now, as previously stated in another episode, Ja Rule was the biggest rapper out for a while in the early 2000's. Platinum records, features, number one singles, babes, bucks, Ja Rule had it all. But, as time went on, people noticed a pattern with him, which was the constant usage of the ""thugs need love too"" formula to make hit songs, and for a long time, he was on top with it. Hit song after hit song, his ""pop gangster"" persona was blowing up, but then, there came a man who saw fit to call out this ""pop rapper"" for what he felt that he was: ""a studio thug"" who purely used his hardcore image to appeal to a female audience. That man was Mr. Curtis Jackson, a.k.a. 50 Cent. He'd call out Ja for not being a heartless thug, and instead being a punk, a softie! *footage of 50 calling out Ja* Sure, there's some origin about 50's friend stealing his chain and Ja Rule seeing that dude and 50 hanging out, but the main thing that people heard about was 50 calling him out for being a fake gangster, and sure enough, when 50 cent came into prominence, he would stamp out all of Ja Rule's club songs and love song, and replace them with… *""In Da Club"" and ""21 Questions""*… with club songs and love songs… Well, to 50's credit though, he did explain himself when releasing ""21 Questions"", the love song I wanted to look at today

When asked by Dr. Dre: ""How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?""

50 Cent responded with: I’m two people. I’ve always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that’s not diversity, it’s necessity

And you know what, I can get behind that, that's the dichotomy of man. you DO have your moments of anger, and you do have your softer sides. You can talk about wanting to kill at one point, and talk about wanting to be loved the next… well, wait a minute, if that's true, Mr. I'm so enlightened to the different aspects of humanity, why did you rag on Ja Rule so much when HE made love songs? What is HE not allowed to have his own dichotomy? That seems a little unfair. Reminds me of when he was in that whole thing with Kanye West, where he was a total sore loser about not selling as many records as Kanye, and decided to randomly taunt him for years, especially for using auto tune *audio clip of ""I Line Niggas', immediately followed by 50 performing ""Love Lockdown""*, but then, wait, what was that song he did the next year with G-Unit?

*""Rider, Part 2""*

Oh yeah, yeah…

So you see, my thing about 50 Cent is that he's always come off as a bit of a hypocritical bully, and with other rappers that I might like, yeah, they may be jackasses, but they do something that makes me look past it, like, yeah, Eminem's an ass, but dammit, he sure knows how to combine lyrics and flow to create masterful verses, and yeah, Kanye's an ass, but dammit, he sure does know how to make good beats and throw in a little socially conscious messages every now and then. But 50 Cent? Yeah, he's an ass, but he sure does, uh… spit typical gangsta rap lyrics over dark beats, because… THAT'S what everyone was waiting for!

But i dunno, if one of my favorite rappers of all time signed him, maybe I should give him a chance. After all, it's not just making a ""thugs need love too"" song that makes me not like a song, it's making a BAD song that makes me not like one, so let's check out ""21 Questions"" by 50 cent, and see how it fares

*intro*

Oh yes, but first we must have awkwardly rushed character establishment. Okay, so how do we establish a rapport between two people in in love in only 20 seconds?

*50 kisses money, laughs, girl in the back laughs*

*Laugh* Yes, I echo your thoughts concerning the hilarity of money

*police arrive*

Oh no, the cops! Maybe making all those songs in which I publicly admit to selling crack wasn't such a good idea!

*cops come in, song starts*

*video shows 50 riding in the back of an cop van*

""New York City! You are now riding… with 50 Cent!

Well, according to this video, you're riding in the back of a cop van. I wouldn't exactly call that your finest hour

You gotta love it!

Personally, I think riding in the back of a police vehicle kind of sucks, but whatever

I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 745

I just wanna let you know before this love song starts that I'm still totally a gangsta by smoking weed and showing off my expensive cars!

Girl, it's easy to love me now

And, of course, 10 points for including the closest thing the new millennium will ever get to Isaac Hayes, Mr. Nate Dogg on the hook

Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

And I gotta give this song a few more points for actually being about something other than the general theme of ""i'm a thug, and you're my main bitch"". Instead of just that, it centers around a sense of doubt about his girlfriend's faithfulness that understandably stems from being really famous and having people around you that only care about you because of your money. He wants someone who's interested in more than money… despite what the intro may lead you to believe

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?

And he starts off by asking directly: if all of his fame was over tomorrow, would you still care about him? It's straight up and to the point. And I wish he would have started with this instead of the ""riding in my car, smoking weed"" nonsense

If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?

You know, for most ""thugs need love too"" songs, they only dwell on a surface level depiction of a relationship, but to ask someone if they'd be willing to be emotional support if they were in jail for 25 years, that requires some reflection. And the delivery makes me feel like it really means something when he says it

If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?

Also, factoring in the realization that this man has actually been shot at 9 times, this is an alarmingly real possibility he's giving this girl to think about

If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?

Okay, that's kinda vague. You might want to elaborate what you mean, because, you know, one might confuse...

I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive

Okay, no confusion here, you're asking her to help you kill somebody. Got it

I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside

Yeah, he's asking questions about how you feel INSIDE, specifically about being an accomplice to murder

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thugging?

Would that be before or AFTER you convinced his daughter to be an accomplice to murder?

Are you mad cause I'm asking you 21 questions?

Uh… does that count as one of the questions? Because now it sounds like you're trolling her. You mad I'm asking' you 21 questions? Yo mad, bruh?

Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?

Now THIS is a deep question, and the wording is important. Do you TRUST me enough to reveal your inner aspirations, the silly pipe dreams that fuel your motivations, or maybe he's talking about the actual dreams that she has every night, the ones that reoccur and haunt her, the ones that subconsciously unpack everything about her fears, joys, and---

I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans

…and… and that was a bad transition. I don't even think that was a question, you just said, ""Baby, tell me about the intricate inner workings of THAT apple bottom ASS… also, ya dreams, and shit...

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see

Okay, this couplet always throws me off, no matter how much credit I try to give this song. Listen to the whole thing

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

Yeah, this always got to me. He says, ""If someone saw me with another girl, NOT if someone just told her he was with another girl, and it was ambiguous as to whether or not it actually happened, no, IF IT WAS TRUE that he was with another women and someone told you about it, will you believe him when he says it wasn't him."" To be clear, part of this song's in-depth compatibility quiz about your integrity as a human being in a relationship fundamentally involves you just kind of accepting the fact that he's eventually going to lie to you.. And what's oddly worse is that, after admitting to being the one who would lie and cheat on her in this example, he shifts the problems of the relationship back on HER

Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

Yes, 50 Cent's girlfriend: after lying and cheating on you, it's clearly YOU who needs to evaluate how seriously you're taking the relationship!

Yeah, these are the lyrics that almost ruin everything this song had going for it. Not the gangsterism's, not the singing intro by 50 cent, not even the line about cake and fat kids

I love you like a fat kid loves cake
You know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile

Yeah, it's corny, but by itself, it's kinda endearing, because in relationships, you're gonna have stupid little things you say to each other, and in the context of a song, if you don't overdo it, it can be fitting, but what ruins this for me is that this lyric comes immediately after the aforementioned lyrics, and sure these questions are mostly hypotheticals, and these scenarios may not have actually happened yet, but in this specific hypothetical situation, he has shown a blatant willingness to shift the blame on her despite him being the one that screwed up, succeeding these lyrics with limp backpedalling

We're only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it takes
I love you lil a fat kid loves cake

And THAT'S what makes this line bad to me: in this instance, after accidentally showcasing a possible warning sign of things to come in their relationship, he acts like a corny joke will be the thing to make her let it go, and that just doesn't gel well with me

Overall, though, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. Never underestimate the power of Nate Dogg's vocals, my friends. And in addition, 50 Cent does actually give a realistic and tangible depiction of his aspirations on relationships, and for about 80% of it, it's relatable and understandable. Yes, it has parts that turn me off of it, but I say in the end, this songs gets a pass from me. And to his credit, at least he didn't pull a Ja Rule, *play ""Always On Time""* and make a quote unquote ""love song"" that, in a sickening revelation, was ultimately just about a pimp-ho relationship. No, 50 Cent was pretty upfront when he made THAT song

*""Cause I' m a mothefuckin' P.I.M.P.!""*

Well, I'm the Rap Critic: You don't have to like my opinion, but I don't have to like your song"

Look at her hips, (what?) look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hitting that from the back (back)
I like it when I touch it cause she moan a lil bit
Jeans sagging so I can see her thong a lil bit
I know you grown a little bit, 20 years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal
I swooped on her like an eagle swooping down on its prey
I know you popular, but you gonna be famous today

Man she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl can I taste yo cat
Gave her 300 to strip, like buying a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events, cuss out the press when she pass
All the high rolling cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half stepping, she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gonna drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops

Ooh, (uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (uh-huh) do what you do (whoo)

[Verse 3]
Gimme what you got for a pork chop
She threw it at me like I was a short-stop
Working in a Fatty Girl Hugga Top
Then she back it up on me and let it drop
Make it hop - boing - like a bunny
Girl can I touch you where it's sunny
Or a purse and make you give her some money
She should pose for Sports Illustrated
It's like a picture perfect site
When she pass all the other girls hate it
(But I...)

Swing your hips when you're walking
Let down your hurr(let down your hurr)

She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread

Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall

[P. Diddy]
Bad Boys 2, the soundtrack
Let's go

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Hey girl, what your name is?
Where you from? Turn around; who you came with?
Is that your ass or your mama half reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at?
I'm still the same cat when I was younger running with bad boys
But now I'm on the hook and so I'm running with Bad Boy
Here come another man, unlike no other man
Candy coated (what!) switching every other lane
Y'all help me, why don't cha please help me
Eighth girl this week and it's only Tuesday
I like the cocky bowlegged ones
Black, white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians, please shake it for Nelly San
Manolos, Ma-no-no's, I can't tell
Everybody ain't that rich, just when you do it, do it well

[Hook: Nelly + (P.D.)]
Let me see you take it low
(Girl, go and take it low)
We can even do it slow
(We can even do it slow)
Take it where you want to go

Now real girls get down on the floor (On the floor)
Now get that money, honey, act like you know (Like you know)
Mama, I like how you dance, the way you fit in them pants (Uh)
And to the floor (Uh) take it low (Uh) girl, do it again (Uh)
You know I love that (I love that)
Now where them girls at? (Where the girls at?)
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee, and Nelly, how you love that?
(Shit, uh ohhhhhh)
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty, how they loving it player?
Baby, you impressive, let's get
To know each other
You the best of the best and
You got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here mama you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it I see your thong
My pocket's full of dough, shake your feathers 'til the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly, man, somebody better warn them

[Hook: Nelly + (P.D.)]
Let me see you take it low

And if my song stop, fuck it 'cause my mic's still on

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee + (Nelly)]
Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like 'em thick with their mind right (Awe)
Banging personality, conversate when the time right (Naw)
I'm not hard, I've got women to handle that
They be like, ""He the man,"" when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on, you know the 'Tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass, popo thinking we mow lawns
My Cole Haans don't match that
But it matches her headwrap and the seats that I got in the 'Lac
I'm just a Juvenile, 'cause I Be about G's
Keep the women Weezy, many say they have my babies
I'm Young like Turk, I like that Cash and that Money
(I'mma eat my money) Man, I'm that damn hungry
You see I'm starvin' like Marvin, girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys, you think I'm valet parking (Get it?)

[Hook: Nelly + (P.D.)]
Let me see you take it low

BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants

But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

Boom, boom, boom
Ha-ha!

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks—thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a manwhore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend/boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

Hey, baby, girl, don't you stop it
Come on, lady, dance all around me

You driving me out of my, out of my mind
Out my mind, ooooh, baby
If I could, I would just be with you, baby
Oooh, 'cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, woo!

You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jammin', havin' deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I'm lovin' the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see

And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin' me

Yeah yeah, DTP, how we do, call you, you can call me
Whatever you want to do baby, come on

[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)

[Verse 1: Chingy]
It was weird how we met, huh?
She was with her mom at Bank America
With my son cashin' a check
So I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world of I, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, mama looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual, walks through the park (Park)
Candle light dinners by dark (Dark), I'm thinking smart (Smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, crush and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up (brrring)
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever thoughts
So I zoomed off
Thinking 'bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (What she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you
Then I say

[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Yo, yo
The next day I'm with the fellas at the cage playin ball
Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin out, tryna dunk, tryna dribble
Break fast through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over, I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying, Lil' Howard you weak'
But you know how that go
What I got they want, what I got I flaunt
Ever mess wit' it? Please don't
Told her I'm goin' home, she asked can she go too
I'm like, ""Yeah boo, I can't see me without you""
Got there, I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong set, I looked at her and said

[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you wanna roll, just)
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)

[Verse 3: Chingy]
Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
But them the kind I put in a place of a child
Don't worry be happy and smile

[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

Teen drinking is very bad
Yo, I got a fake ID though
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, two step with me, two step with me

[Verse 1]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin', he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, man, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga, you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun
While she goin' down, I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch, give it back, now you don't get none

[Chorus]
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)

[Verse 2]
Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass, now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl, you twenty-one? Girl, that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries
If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

[Chorus]
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)

[Verse 3]
Three, here comes the four to the five to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes, single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch
Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit
With some orange juice, man, this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club owner said, ""Kwon put out those trees!""
Dude, I don't care, I'm a P.I.M.P.

Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming, ""My, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream

With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life

I'm a dick thrower, her neck and her back hurting
Cut throater, have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get off me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick like

Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me, I'm strong
If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

[Verse 4: Juvenile]
I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample
Who you with? I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me?

Feel this shit right here, Scott Storch, nigga
Yeah Khaled, I see you nigga, show Big Pun love
Uh, yeah, uh, yo

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance

Now lean back, lean back

R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K Crip walkin' like, ""That's what's up!""
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back

The things we do (Things we do)
Are just between me and you, yeah (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa"
52,Hate It or Love It,The Game featuring 50 Cent,"April 23, 2005","[Produced By: Cool & Dre]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me"

Yeah, Shady, Aftermath, G-Unit
Damn baby all I need is a lil' bit
A lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Get it crackin' in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to whippin' that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

[Verse 1]
I step up in the club I'm like ""Who you wit?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm tryin' to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'mma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'mma get in shorty ear and I'mma let her know

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit

[Verse 2]
This is 50, comin' out your stereo
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh man""
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit

[Bridge]
Baby you got me feelin' right, you heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin' I'm tryin' to fuck tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon, ha ha

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit

All a nigga really need is a lil' bit

Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me

(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

[Bow Wow]
I'm Bow Weezy, prince of the O-town
Just got the wheels clean, so I'm riding slow now
I'm in a fast car, something like a NASCAR
If you wanna know how much it cost you should ask pa
As far as the watch and chain
I dropped some change, its easy for me to cop them things
And I don't stop, I got rocks and rings, you know
The same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the back yard
I ain't gotta act hard, I'm under 21 with a black card
And yea I know that was kind of a low blow
But the dough for the So So don't come slow

[Chorus: JD]
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one

Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit this one

[Verse 1: Nelly & Brandy]
Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 more at the top

If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changing grills everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil mama love it
Cause when I...
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming (say what)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (chiefing)
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating (What)
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating (Hah)

Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry

But for right now, what we gotta do for y'all (what we gonna do)
We gotta give y'all a hit (huh)

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Niggas in my face, damn near er' day
Ask a million questions like, Joc where ya' stay?
Tell 'em Collegepark, where they chop cars
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood, posted at the store
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough
If a girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me, I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what you do (OK)

Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
Verse number two, do the damn thing
Cubes on my neck, pockets full of Ben Frank's
When I'm in the mall, hoes just pause
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work, make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boy magic, seven days a week
Number one record, long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I think they like me, better yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew, we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout thirty-five cars
Bitches in the back, black Beamer coupe's
Girls liking girls, time to recruit
If ya' got a problem, say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

Time to set it off, let these nigga know
Have ya ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya' see the buckets on my feet
Fans on my trail, but they don't think I know
I keep my hands clean casue I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in they eyes
Ask me how I know, its me, surprise
Put it in the air, rep where ya' stay
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats
I'mma make it rain nigga, I ain't scared to share it

Triple black Phantom, nigga, nah, it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charms, diamonds, man, but nah, it ain't Flip
Can't bounce, okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk, and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, brown Rover look like pork and beans
Everybody know me in the club cause they smoking me
Dro, hoes scoping me, ice come from Boca Raton
Hundred karats have 'em froze for an eon
Red, black, and white Chevy, now I'm riding Deion
Put them lights off in my rims, now I'm riding neon
Our cars look like cra-yon, hoes know I'm the man though

My bitch break niggas, after that we fuck they girlfriend
My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Nigga, it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Benz, cocking hammer, Arm & Hammer propaganda
Bitches think I'm pimping in linen and salamander sandals
Dirty South hot cause Atlanta, show niggas with ammo
We ride Phantom, holler shorty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET our channel
Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumping and punking monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies

67,We Fly High,Jim Jones,"January 20, 2007","[Produced by Zukhan]

[Intro]
I wear a mean dark pair of shades
And you can't see my eyes
Unless my head is bent, you dig

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 1]
Ya boy gettin' paper (money), I buy big cars (foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (choose one!)
Stay sky high, twisted, fly with the stars (twinkle, twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin' (flossin'!)
I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (do it!)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistenin' (ballin'!)
But I spent 'bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (what else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!""

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 2]
Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (one chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow (speedin'!)
100 G's worth of ice on the Audemars (flossin'!)
And we in the street life 'til they call the law (ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (what happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 AM we was at the club (what happened?)
2 AM: ten bottles of bub (money ain't a thing)
And 'bout 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (twisted)

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 3]
Nigga, could you buy that? I keep 20 in the pocket (light change)
Talk a buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (that Grey Poupon)
But of course got a Flying Spur
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (get your money up!)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge (speedin'!)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous, livin' in the fast lane (ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'ma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Outro]
You niggas need to stay focused
When you're dealin' with a motherfuckin' G
You know my name, Jones, One Eye, Capo Status
All the above, motherfucka
This Dipset, ByrdGang, we born to fly
Y'all know the rules: fall back or fall back
Someone tell my bitch Summer I'm lookin' for her
Ya dig, another day another dollar, fast life fucka"
68,Runaway Love,Ludacris featuring Mary J. Blige,"February 10, 2007","[Intro]
Yeah, and it go a little somethin'
Li-li-like this

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway runaway love
Don't keep runnin away
I'll run away with you, if you want me to
Lahhhhhhh

[Outro: Ludacris]
Yeah, I can only imagine what you goin through ladies
Sometimes I feel like runnin away myself
So do me a favor right now and close your eyes
And picture us runnin away together
When we come back everything gonna be okay
Open your eyes"
69,This Is Why I'm Hot,Mims,"March 17, 2007","[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply:

[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme whachu got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean

[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say ""Yeah, I paid a guap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em ""All aboard""
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply ""Nobody got to die""
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire

[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)"

Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin 'er off, cause she ain't with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil' mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat her hunda

Welcome to the good life, where niggas who sell D

Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like NY, summertime Chi
Ah! (Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!

[Bridge]
Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, ""Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up""
The good life

It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C
It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay
Ayy, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)
Homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood (Welcome to the good life)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain
Whipped it out, she said ""I never seen Snakes on a Plane""
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
'Cause (The good life) I always had a passion for flashin'
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

[Outro: T-Pain]
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin' me ""baby""
If you feelin' me now
Then put yo hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Hey, hey, ooh I'm good!"

Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)

I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin' X and O
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them

Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy groan
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her

Whoa, shawty
Yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin'
And them Rosay bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock

When you call her on her cellular, she tell you she don't need
Not a goddamn thang, you a hot damn thang
If you think you finna get her with a goddamn chain
You insane, boy you better get some goddamn change
She a fool, been to school, even walked across the stage
And she say, ""I love Webbie from his looks to his ways""
The stilettos the J's depend on how the weather look
Flip flop slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggas depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own, I don't think she'll never look
In a man face standin waitin for him to take care of her
She'll rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Motherfucker, I'm ill

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air

He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat"

Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that Glock on me
Don't get caught without one, coming from where I'm from

I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame, man, that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man, that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least, uh, one of Russell's nieces
On, I let my nightmares go
I put on everybody that I knew from the 'Go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke
They say, ""Damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more?""
""You got that big fame, homie, and you just changed on me""
You can ask big homie, man, the top so lonely

[Intro: T.I.]
Ay... this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)

Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)

And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake

No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright 'cause

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey"

You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

[Verse 1]
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

[Verse 2]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it

When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up

You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)

90,Run This Town,Jay-Z featuring Rihanna and Kanye West,"September 26, 2009","[Produced by Kanye West & No I.D]

[Intro: Rihanna]
Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up!

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, this the return of the God
Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table, screamin'
""Fuck the other side! They're jealous!""
We got a banquette full of broads
They got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in
‘Cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like millionaires' row

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels.""
""Is that a May— what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels.""
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel

[Outro: Jay Z & Rihanna]
Whassup!
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Yeah, yeah, whassup!
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
We gon' run this town tonight"
91,Forever,"Drake featuring Kanye West, Lil Wayne and Eminem","November 14, 2009","[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane"

Yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos (Dinero!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (Ayy, aha) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle (Yeah) where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Yeah) (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Aha, aha, aha) (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (New)
Big lights will inspire you (Come on) (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (You welcome, OG) (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh) (I made you hot, nigga)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice Cee Lo, three card Marley
Labor Day Parade – rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo – I'm from the Empire State, that's

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (Ayy) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (That boy good) (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Welcome to the bright lights, baby) (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (Ayy, ow) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)

One hand in the air for the big city (Oh)
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Oh)
No place in the world that could compare (Nah)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
""Yeah, yeah"" (Come on, come on)
""Yeah, yeah"" (Come on)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
In New York (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)"
