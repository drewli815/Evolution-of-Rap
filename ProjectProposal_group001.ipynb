Can we form the conclusion that the main topics in rap and their beat/rhythm have not changed after performing an analysis of the Billboard's number-one rap singles for each decade ranging from the 1980s to the 2010s?*"

    "- We realized that contemporary music is repetitive because a lot of songs have a repeating theme in the form of either lyrics or the type of beat. This is very evident in contemporary rap. A lot of rap songs cover the same topics: guns, liquor, drugs, money, sex, getting famous, being rich, etc. But one has to consider the type of beat that rap music uses. It's quite hard to tell the difference from one rap song to another if you were to just listen to the instrumental versions. The dull and repetitive nature of rap comes from exactly this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Therefore, in order to measure the monotony, we will be accumulating data from thousands of songs ranging from the 1980s - 2010s and performing an analysis on their overarching themes, word counts, and their tempo/energy. The American rap genre will be considered to have evolved from innovative to monotonous if rap music from the 1980s covers a range of topics other than the ones listed above as opposed to contemporary rap. In the 20th century, rap music was much more impactful and many pieces pushed to make public change. Nowadays, that isn't always the case. At least, not as often.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The overarching theme of each song will be the most repeated keyword (after removing common english words), word counts will be some sort of map or Counter that associates frequencies with words, and the tempo/energy will be pulled directly from Spotify's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We believe there should be a change in the music industry. Today's music industry makes music that is solely for 'instant gratification' and is completely shallow. (Refer to the second resource in the *Past Studies* section below)\n",

    "- We all listen to and enjoy music.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Past Studies\n",
    "    - There is an article that has illustrated the 23 most repetitive rappers, the highest being Will.I.Am and Kid Cudi. The analysis looked at how often certain keywords were said, but only compared it from artist to artist.\n",

   "source": [
    "*After conducting a thorough analysis of music repetition, we believe that there exists a trend in contemporary rap music. This trend will be evident after comparing the overarching themes of rap music and average measurements of tempo and energy for each decade. We expect that, through these observations, we will find a repetitive trend because contemporary rap music focuses on the same topics and recycles the same beat/rhythm for each song whereas older rap music used to cover a diverse range of topics and beats/rhythm so that each song and artist was refreshing and unique.*"

    "- What variables: song name, song title, song year, lyrics for song (dataframe 1), and keywords with their respective counts (dataframe 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many observations: Varies depending on how many songs are on each Billboard for each decade. We will have to find a way to normalize our data so that the number of songs for each decade are the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Who/what/how would these data be collected: \n",
    "    - Who\n",
    "        - Each week, teams will be formed and tasks will be assigned to each subteam so that we can achieve maximum efficiency in data collection. Everyone's time would not be spent completing the same task and we will finish the project quicker. For example, team A may be tasked with data collection while team B will be in charge of parsing through it for cleaning (removing stop words, stemming, etc.)\n",
    "    - What\n",
    "        - At first, we will be collecting song names, artists, and the date at which each song reached number one. Then, using lyrics extractor, we will find the lyrics for each song. At this point, this is all the data collection we need. Additional steps include parsing through the data and removing common English words.\n",
    "    - How\n",
    "        - First using Billboard's number-one songs and exporting as a csv file. Then, we will read it in as a dataframe so that we can then iterate through each song title and run the lyrics extractor package on it. Then we will simply store each lyric body in the dataframe, remove any common English words from each lyric body, and iterate through all of the lyrics and associate counts with each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How would these data be stored/organized: Pandas dataframe which will eventually be converted back to a csv to be stored in google sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "- What kind of songs are you collecting: We will be collecting Billboard's number-one songs for each decade from the 1980s to the 2010s. The number of songs for each decade varies, so we will have to establish a numerical bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notes\n",
    "    - We will ONLY be looking at rap songs for this analysis. This is purely from Wikipedia's Billboard number-one list so that we get a rough estimate of what the most popular songs are for each decade. \n",
    "    - Because we have a method of retrieving all of the lyrics for each song in our data set, we know that we will have more than 25000+ words to parse through, which is more than enough to model the overarching themes for each decade for comparison with one another. "
