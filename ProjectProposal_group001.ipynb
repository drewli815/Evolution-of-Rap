    "- We all listen to and enjoy music.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We realized that contemporary music is repetitive because a lot of songs have a repeating theme in the form of either lyrics or the type of beat. This is very evident in contemporary rap. A lot of rap songs cover the same topics: guns, liquor, drugs, money, sex, getting famous, being rich, etc. But one has to consider the type of beat that rap music uses. It's quite hard to tell the difference from one rap song to another if you were to just listen to the instrumental versions. The dull and repetitive nature of rap comes from exactly this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Therefore, in order to measure the monotiny, we will be accumulating data from thousands of songs ranging from the 1970s - 2010s and performing an analysis on their overarching themes, word counts, and their tempo/energy. The American rap genre will be considered to have evolved from innovative to monotonous if rap music from the 1970s cover a range of topics other than the ones listed above as opposed to contemporary rap. In the 20th century, rap music was much more impactful and many pieces pushed to make public change. Nowadays, that isn't always the case. At least, not as often.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The overarching theme of each song will be the most repeated keyword (after removing common english words), word counts will be some sort of map or Counter that associates frequencies with words, and the tempo/energy will be pulled directly from Spotify's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Past Studies\n",
    "    - There is an article that has illustrated the 23 most repetitive rappers, the highest being Will.I.Am and Kid Cudi. The analysis looked at how often certain keywords were said, but only compared it from artist to artist.\n",
    "        - https://www.rapanalysis.com/2015/08/the-23-most-repetitive-rappers/ \n",
    "    - In this tiny piece (written 9 years ago), talks about how music used to promote good values, but in the 21st century, it has completely shifted to a shallow and superficial genre. He adds a quote from one of Drake's songs that only focuses on the aspects of life that are instantly gratifying: getting money, drinking, and smoking, namely. \n",
