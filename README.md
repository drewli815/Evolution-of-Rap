# Evolution-of-Rap
## Project Overview:

In our project, we wanted to determine if rap music has changed over the last few decades. We gathered data from Billboard's Hot Weekly charts containing 28000+ songs and trimmed it down to approximately 3800 rap songs. From our analysis, we found that the overarching themes of rap vary from decade to decade and that this may have to do with global events occurring at that time. The data suggests, however, that love was consistently talked about and that rap post-2000s deviated from social good to self-gratification.
